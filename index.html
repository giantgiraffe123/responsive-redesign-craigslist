      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        As users in a digital world, we have all come across websites where we
        thought to ourselves, “Hmm this is not a great website.” Many websites
        have issues related to usability, learnability, memorability, and
        accessibility as well as poor design choices in general that hinder the
        user’s experience.

      <h2>Craigslist: A Case Study</h2>
      <img src="images/craig.png" />
      <p>
        Craigslist is a website that allows users to post listings to buy and
        sell items while also having many other features like job listings,
        discussion boards, and local events. The company was founded in 1995 and
        its website has barely been updated since. While some may be proponents
        of its “simple” interface, I argue that it is not as simple and
        intuitive as it may seem. For this project, I will be redesigning the
        main landing page of Craigslist, which as you can see below is a bit
        chaotic and overwhelming. You can view the site <a href="https://providence.craigslist.org/"> here</a>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Usability Issues - Conceptual Model</h2>
      <p>
        When a user first looks at this page, they develop a
        <b><i>conceptual model</i></b>
        about how to use the interface. Based on the design of the interface,
        users are immediately drawn to the leftmost "header" column where the
        website title and other seemingly important information one would think
        would be held. The issue here is that the website does not follow this
        conceptual model because most of this information in the left column is
        useless. In fact, the right column - which is where users would
        typically look last - is actually where they should go to first because
        they need to first select a location to view listings for. The layout
        here is not intuitive to the proper conceptual model.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Usability Issues - Location</h2>
      <p>
        One of Craigslist's main draws is finding/selling things in your area,
        yet selecting location is a difficult task with this design. As
        mentioned above, location is one of the first things a user needs to
        select, but it is set far to the right of the website, which is not the
        first place a user is drawn when they open the site. Furthermore, the
        design of the location selector leads to several usability issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        As shown below, the location section has 5 main categories -
        <i>nearby cl</i> which lists seemingly random cities that are "nearby"
        (although this is not clear what qualifies as "nearby" given Albany and
        Philadelphia are pretty far from Providence ), <i>us cities</i> which
        lists some but not all city options in the US, <i>us states</i> which
        lists all the states, <i>canada</i> if you are interested in searching
        in canada, and <i>cl worldwide</i> which includes other countries and
        continents.
      </p>

      <img src="images/craig_us.png" style="padding-bottom: 3%;"/>

      <p>
        This way of selecting a location is not easily learnable because each
        section interacts differently. Sometimes you can just choose a city, but
        if you choose a state, you may be redirected to another page to choose a
        city, but not always. Even though there is a section for US cities, it
        doesn't include all the cities - more options pop up later when you
        chose a state.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also it is an interesting choice to have a full separate section for
        Canada and then another separate section for other countries. Using the
        worldwide tab is also not intuitive because the sublinks look like the
        same links as all the other ones, but some actually act as headers and
        expand to reveal more options as is shown below with Asia. Furthermore,
        once pressing on a country from the worldwide section, the whole right
        bar is rerendered to show different headings (like shown in the India
        example below). So while these options look vaguely like headings that
        should be static, they in fact change.
      </p>

      <img src="images/craig_wl.png" style="padding-bottom: 3%;" />

      <p>
        This leads to issues with memorability because even if a user manages to
        figure out how to get to a desired location one time, they will likely not
        remember this when they use the website again in a few days or weeks. They may
        know they got there before but the layout is confusing so it is hard to know
        what order to click things in. Another with usability of the location
        feature is if users are exploring locations, end up in a different continent,
        sometimes the US option disappears or becomes buried and it may be hard
        to work their way back.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Usability Issues - Link Inconsistencies</h2>
      <p>
        The left sidebar is cluttered with links that are not super important and take up
        valuable space. They also present mutliple usability issues related to usability,
        learnability, and memorability. Some of these links don't have intuitive names.
        For example, the <i>help, faq, abuse, legal</i> line on the left is actually one link that
        leads to a help page. In fact, many of these links go to the same place as shown 
        below. Some have different names yet go to the same place, and some are simply repeated twice.
        This leads to confusion for users who wonder if links with the same name do different things - because
        why else would there be two of the same thing. However, some of the redundant links link to 
        the same page while others link to different pages. This also causes memorability issues 
        because a user will have a difficult time remembering which link they can use to get to which place.
      </p>
      <img src="images/redundant-links.png" style="padding-bottom: 3%;">
      <p>
        Below shows some of this confusion with the <i>help, faq, abuse, legal</i> link on the left
        linking to the same link as the <i>help</i> link at the bottom. Similarly, users might think
        that <i>personal safety tips</i> on the left would link to the same place as <i>safety</i> on the bottom,
        however, this <i>safety</i> link really links to a page about scams, the same page as the <i>avoid scams & fraud</i>
        link that is on the left.
      </p> 
      <img src="images/dif-link-names.png" style="padding-bottom: 3%;">
      <p>As you can see, these links are a mess, not to mention they aren't organized into related categories and placed
        all in one central location.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Usability Issues - General</h2>
      <p>
       Other issues with the design of the site that impact the user expperience are as follows:
       <ul type="square">
        <li>
          Naturally people gravitate towards the middle, but there is so much text thrown at you here that it can get overwhelming, especially because the search bar is not featured front and center but rather hid off towards the left
        </li>
        <li>
          Links are organized grouped into categories and then a bunch of links to subcategories are listed alphabetically. There can be over 30 of these
          links, but simply listing them all isn't the most useful to quickly find what the user is looking for. 
          It is too much information to process at once, and could better be broken down by further subcategories to make the experience more efficient
        </li>
        <li>
          Links use abbreviated names that are not always clear - for example, "eco" in the discussion section links to 
          a forum on ecology, but based on "eco", one could think it links to economics, eco-friendliness, or something else
        </li>
        <li>
          All the links being displayed at once makes it take longer for the user to find what they came for. For example, if I came to look for a job, I don't want
          to have to sift through a bunch of other information to find my category of interest
        </li>
        <li>
          There is no button to sign into your account or view if you are logged in </li>
        <li>
          Headings for the categories are not very clear and don't stand out / convey a good hierarchy
        </li>
        <li>
          Webpage is not responsive so shrinking the window makes the user need to scroll the window over to see the rest of the site
        </li>
        <li>
          Not clear what the calendar is for. It is also not labeled with the month, does not allow toggling between months, 
          and doesn't follow the traditional calendar structre (it show four weeks ahead instead of the current month). The calendar
          is also very small and does not resize
       </ul>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Usability Issues - Accessibility</h2>
      <p>
        According to the accessibility site <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WebAIMWAVE</a>, the original Craigslist does not
        have many accessibility issues. One of the things WAVE mentioned that I agree with is that some of the text is too small. Especially
        because the content does not resize, some of the links are small and cannot get bigger, particularly in the discussion forums
        section. Although that section is particularly small, a lot of the links are small too and could be more accessible with a bigger font. 
      </p>
      <p>
        WAVE also mentioned some things more on the code side that prevents the site from being accessible to screen readers, such as the search bar missing
        a form label, no language being specified for the website, and some hidden aria content is not presented to screen readers. These are issues
        that should be fixed to make the site more accessible
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing that WAVE didn't mention but I think could be an issue is the brightness of the blue that makes up the text of 
        all the main links on the screen. Since nearly all the content is links, this leads to a lot of blue that 
        could be bright and overwhelming to some peoples' eyes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Low-Fi Prototyping</h2>
      <p>
        As a first step in redesigning Craigslist to make it responsive and more user friendly,
        I made three low-fidelity wireframes using Balsamiq to visualize the layouts for a desktop,
        tablet, and mobile phone. As I designed these prototypes, I considered the usability problems 
        identified above and the sticky notes below explain how these issues were addressed. The layout
        is also respsonsive which is why content looks similar across devices.

      <h2>Visual Design Style Guide</h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 1%">As a first step in the design process, I created the following visual design documentation in Figma
        that details reusable components that will be in my design as well as some fonts, colors, and other elements.

      <p style="margin-bottom: 1%">The following are my high-fidelity prototypes I created using Figma and are annotated
        with comments on how to implement the design using html and css properties. In my implementation,
        I plan to use bootstrap libaries, so I included references to those libaries in my comments (such as
        <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/"> the grid system</a>, <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/">buttons</a>,
        <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/accordion/">accordians</a>, and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/">navbars</a>).
        Since my prototypes span more than the height of a screen, the following are static screenshots of my figma prototypes.

        After putting my prototypes into action, I have completed my responsive redesign of Craiglist. View the final result at

        to see how this site would look on different screen sizes. Enjoy the new and improved Craigslist experience :)

    <div class="container">
      <h5>Comments</h5>
      <p id="ps">
        Note that the website is not completely responsive to clicks because javascript was not required for this assignment. For example the accordians can open using 
        bootstrap's collapse library but clicking them again does not close them, but ideally
        this would be the target behavior in a fully functional website.</p>
      <p id="ps">Similarly, other 
        interactive elements are not completely interactive for this preliminary redesign.
        For example, in a future design of this project, I would like to be able to collapse
        the subheadings that use the <i class="bi bi-caret-right-fill"></i> icon and only expand
        the sub-category the user is interested in, but that requires javascript.
      </p>
      <p id="ps">
        Additionally, the header didn't come out exactly how I envisioned, and I spent a great deal
        of time playing with it, but ultimately was unable to do what I hoped with my (nonexistent) html/css background
